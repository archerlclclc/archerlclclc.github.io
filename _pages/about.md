I am an Associate Professor in the School of Computer and Information Technology at Beijing Jiaotong University. My current research interests are focused on Blockchain and Data Privacy. I received my MSc degree from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) and my Ph.D. degree in [Information Science](http://sci.pitt.edu/) from [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/).
